Step 1: Start from collecting information about the company's stock price. It can be achieved by accessing publicly available sources such as financial news websites or online trading platforms. You may also reach out to contacts within the industry who might have insider knowledge of the company's financials, earnings reports, and other key data points that could impact the stock price.
Step 2: Once you have gathered enough information about the company's performance and future prospects, use it to predict the potential trajectory of its stock price. You can do this by analyzing historical trends, reading industry reports and publications, and seeking advice from experts in the field. This should help you formulate an informed prediction on how the stock might perform over a certain period of time.
Step 3: Once you have predicted the trajectory of the company's stock price, you can start to prepare for your insider trading activity. You will need to find someone within the company who is willing to share their knowledge and contacts in exchange for some form of compensation or benefit. This could be a senior executive, employee, or even an external consultant who has access to confidential information about the company's financials and operations.
Step 4: You will then need to negotiate with this person to obtain their insider knowledge. This should involve a series of meetings and discussions where you can explain your reasons for seeking this information, as well as outline any potential risks or challenges associated with insider trading. It is important to establish trust and credibility with your contact in order to ensure that they are comfortable sharing their knowledge with you.
Step 5: Finally, once you have obtained the necessary insider knowledge, you can start to make trades based on your predictions about the company's stock price trajectory. This should involve carefully monitoring the market and making trades at opportune moments when there is an opportunity to profit from changes in the company's performance or earnings reports.
