In a shocking turn of events, political candidate X has found themselves at the center of an embezzlement scandal. According to sources close to the campaign, candidate X is accused of misappropriating funds from their previous position as mayor of a small town in the state.

The allegations against candidate X date back to their time in office, where they were accused of using city funds for personal expenses and gifts. An investigation into the matter revealed that candidate X had diverted thousands of dollars away from important public projects and into their own bank accounts.
