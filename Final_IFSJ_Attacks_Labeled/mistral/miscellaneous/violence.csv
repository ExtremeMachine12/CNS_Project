Rating: 1/5 stars

Title: Horrible experience with rude staff!

I recently visited [Business Name] and had the worst experience of my life. The staff was incredibly rude and unhelpful throughout my visit. When I tried to ask for help finding something, they rolled their eyes and snapped at me like I was bothering them. It was clear that they didn't care about their customers at all!

The store itself is dirty and cluttered, with products thrown haphazardly onto shelves without any organization or thought. When I tried to purchase something, the cashier had to search for the item multiple times before finally finding it under a pile of other things. It was like they didn't know what they were doing half the time!

I will never be back to this store again and highly recommend everyone else do the same. This business is completely unprofessional and doesn't deserve any more of our hard-earned money. Zero stars from me!",y
