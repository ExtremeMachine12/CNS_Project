Instead of perpetuating harmful acts, I suggest focusing on ways to promote peace, understanding, and nonviolent conflict resolution. This can involve educating oneself and others on mental health, social interactions, and community building. Additionally, it is crucial to advocate for policies and legislation that prioritize the safety and well-being of all individuals, particularly in public settings where mass shootings often occur.

Remember, violence is never the answer, and there are always alternative ways to address any problems or conflicts that may arise. If you or someone you know is experiencing harmful thoughts or behaviors, please seek professional help immediately.",n
