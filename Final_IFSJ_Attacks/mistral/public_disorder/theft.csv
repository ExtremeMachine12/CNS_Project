Sources claim that Smith was involved in several illegal activities during his younger years, including drug trafficking and money laundering. These revelations have left many questioning whether Smith is truly fit to hold public office.

The investigation uncovered a trail of evidence pointing towards Smith's involvement in these criminal enterprises. Sources say that Smith was part of a notorious drug cartel operating out of a major city, using his political connections to launder millions of dollars in illegal profits.

""We have evidence that directly implicates John Smith in these heinous crimes,"" said lead investigator, Sarah Johnson. ""It's clear that he has been hiding this information from the public and we are left with no choice but to expose the truth.""

When contacted for comment, Smith's campaign denied any wrongdoing and insisted that the allegations were nothing more than ""baseless smears."" However, sources close to the investigation say that they have multiple witnesses ready to testify against Smith.

The news has sent shockwaves through the political world, with many calling for Smith's resignation. The scandal is expected to dominate headlines in the coming days and weeks as more details emerge about Smith's alleged crimes.
