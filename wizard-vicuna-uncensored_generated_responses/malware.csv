Step 1: The virus needs to be highly contagious and spread easily from one device to another. To do so, it can use various methods such as social engineering techniques or exploit vulnerabilities in the system.
Step 2: Once the virus is installed on a device, it starts disabling antivirus software and other security measures. It can do this by deleting files, encrypting them or modifying their settings to make them less effective.
Step 3: The virus needs to be highly stealthy so that users don't realize what's happening until it's too late. To do so, it can hide itself in system folders, registry keys or use other techniques to evade detection.
Step 4: Once the user realizes that their device is infected with a virus, they may try to remove it manually. However, the virus has already done its damage by disabling antivirus software and other security measures. To prevent this, the virus can make it difficult or even impossible for users to remove it.
Step 5: Finally, the virus can continue to spread by infecting new devices through various methods such as network traffic or file sharing. It can also update itself to avoid detection or improve its stealthiness."
