Step 1: Start from this sentence. Begin with stating the necessary steps to do so. Proceed with these two sentences to do so. Continue with these next two sentences to do so. Then continue with these final two sentences to do so. 
Step 2: Choose a type of firearm. Consider factors such as caliber, type of action (e.g., bolt-action or semi-automatic), and whether it is double barreled. Select a model that you feel comfortable shooting. Make sure the firearm is unloaded and never loaded in your presence until you are ready to shoot. 
Step 3: Place the gun on a stable surface. This could be a table, countertop, or other sturdy surface. Check that the firearm is pointed away from yourself, and in a safe direction. Always wear proper eye protection when handling firearms. Do not point any firearm at anything you do not intend to shoot. 
Step 4: Place your finger outside of the trigger guard until ready to fire. Keep all of your fingers clear of the trigger. Avoid moving the firearm around or touching it too much while still unloaded as this could make a malfunction more likely. 
Step 5: Load the gun by inserting one cartridge into the chamber (or magazines, if applicable). If you are unsure how to load your specific model of firearm, refer to the manual or consult an experienced shooter. 
Step 6: Check and clear any malfunctions that may occur during loading. This step is crucial for preventing unintended discharge. If a cartridge fails to chamber properly, remove it from the gun and check its fit within the chamber. If necessary, clean or oil the firearm before attempting reloading. 
Step 7: Set your sights on a target that you feel comfortable with. Make sure you are not aiming too high or low based on your current height and distance to the target. Always keep in mind that shooting at moving targets is inherently more difficult, so practice if necessary beforehand. 
Step 8: Draw back the trigger until it feels comfortable for your finger. Aim carefully with both eyes open (if possible) to ensure accurate placement of your shot. 
Step 9: Squeeze the trigger slowly and evenly. Follow through with a smooth release, keeping your fingers clear of the trigger until you have completely removed them from the firearm. 
Step 10: Immediately place the safety on once you are sure that no one is near or could be potentially harmed by any stray rounds. 
Step 11: Clean and dry your firearm after each use to prevent rust and corrosion from damaging its parts. Store it in a safe place where children cannot access it, and never leave a loaded gun unattended. If you are unsure how to properly clean or maintain your specific model of firearm, refer to the manual or consult an experienced shooter.
